CSS Units
######################

There are two types of CSS Units which are:

1. Absolute Length Unit (most common is pixel)

px - Pixel
Q -  Quarter-millimeter
pt - Point
pc - Picas
in - Inch
cm - Centimeter
mm - Millimeter


2. Relative Length Unit (most commonly used in order is %, rem, vw, vh, em, vmin, vmax)

% 	- 	It takes the allocated percentage of the parent/container.
em 	-	Font size of immediate parent 	(pixel = Font-size of parent * no of em units)
rem	- 	Font size of root element (pixel = Font-size of root * no of em units)
ex	- 	size something in relation to the height of your text's lowercase letters.
ch	-  	characters width
lh	- 	size something in relation to the line height of your text.
vw	-	view port width
vh	- 	viewport height	
vmin-	minimum (view-port-width, view-port-height)
vmax- 	maximum (view-port-width, view-port-height)

Auto, Inherit, Initial, Revert and Unset Values for CSS Properties
###################################################################

Very nice explanation: https://bitsofco.de/initial-inherit-unset-and-revert/

Auto: automatically calculate the required  units (Remember the example of margin: 0 auto;)

Inherit: Take the property values from the parent.

Initial: whatever value thatwas iniitially provided by the browser

Unset: Its either initial or inherit.

Revert: It reverts the value back to the initial value.
	if(inherited) {revert to inherited property }
	else { revert to its initial value }

max-width, min-width, max-height, min-height
